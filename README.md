# Project explanation

This project implements an application to register day-to-day TO DO Task. The project has been created through the command  `npx create vite@latest` , which provides a basic template to work with React, Typescript and ESLint.

## Features
- Login and route protection
- CRUD of TO DO tasks.

## Main dependencies

In addition to the minimum dependencies provided by vite, the following have been added:

- `TailwindCSS`: to quickly style and shape our entire application.
- `React Router DOM`: to handle navigation between components.
- `Redux Toolkit`: to simplify  store setup, creating reducer and manage states.
- `Vitest & React Testing Library`: for testing purposes.

## Future improvements

- Implement the [Cookie Store API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API) when all browsers support this feature. 
- Add loaders in login.
- Add toast notifications in some TO DO actions, like delete.
- Improve testing.
